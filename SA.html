document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "South Australia’s Case for Space";
document.getElementById("myS").innerHTML = "The Proposal";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "In August  2020, a major project was declared by the South Australian Government based on a proposal by South Australian launch company Southern Launch. The proposal included building basic infrastructure for a series of test launch in order to assess the potential location of an orbital space launch facility at Whalers Way, Sleaford. The proposed site is located at the southern tip of the Eyre Peninsula, approximately 21 kilometres south-west of the regional city of Port Lincoln. In May 2021 public consultation was sought by the  State Commission Assessment Panal. I provided support in writing and as a verbal submission to the panel. The following is a summary of my submission to the panel.";

document.getElementById("mySS").innerHTML = "About Me";
document.getElementById("myPP").innerHTML = "I am supporting this proposal as a South Australian and someone enthusiastic about Space exploration. I am currently employed as a Software tester and have a background in science communication. I am not an aerospace professional.";

document.getElementById("mySSS").innerHTML = "Reasons to support the proposal";

document.getElementById("myPPP").innerHTML = "There are three reasons to that I believe that this proposal should be supported.";

document.getElementById("mySSSS").innerHTML = "1. Economic Growth";

document.getElementById("myPPPP").innerHTML = "I believe that Australia’s future prosperity rests in a smart and agile economy which leverages the latest technology, an educated population as well as automation. Currently, Australia (particularly SA) has an imbalance of Satellite companies compared to launch providers. There are currently no operational commercial providers and no dedicated spaceports in Australia Options for launch are limited to either New Zealand or United States commercial launch providers. \n As Flavia Nadini, CEO and cofounder of Fleet Space Technology has said; “rockets are the bottleneck of our industry… we’re always waiting for rockets.”. \n Launching to space from the Eyre peninsula could boost local and interstate tourism, at a time its needed most.";

document.getElementById("myS2").innerHTML = "2.	Sovereign Security";

document.getElementById("myP2").innerHTML = "Australia is currently at the mercy of global events and at the space priorities other nations, this is especially the case for an future Australia without launch capacity.  As we have seen in the last 18 months, global supply chains and international travel are easily disrupted and are at the mercy of overseas companies and government. Should our space infrastructure come under accidental or deliberate attack, we have  no options to quickly launch from Australia in order to replace, repair or defend our space infrastructure. Launching from the United States, is not always ideal. According to RocketLab’s CEO and cofounder Peter Beck, the wait for US launch windows are not only infrequent and competitive, the launches cause disruptions to both air and shipping corridors. This is what lead to RocketLab making its first orbital launch site in New Zealand, where air and sea corridors are relatively less. Such a consideration make’s locations like Whaler’s Way a desirable opportunity.";

document.getElementById("myS3").innerHTML = "3.	Fostering an interest in STEM";

document.getElementById("myP3").innerHTML = "Although satellite manufacturing and GIS software are interesting, nothing captures the public attention as much as the technology trying to break free of Earth's gravity. Small medium or large, all launch vehicles are captivating. Promoting STEM has a follow-on effect on the two previous points; Economic Launch has far reaching capacity - an interest in STEM can ensure that Australia has new generations of scientists and engineers - bolstering our sovereign technological edge and adding to economic growth through innovation.";
